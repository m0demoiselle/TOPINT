                <p>Rank and organization: First Sergeant, U.S. Army, Company A, 4th
                    Battalion, 9th Infantry, 25th Infantry Division. Place and date: Near Phu
                    Hoa Dong, Republic of Vietnam, 26 February 1967. Entered service at:
                    Eugene, Oreg. Born: 29 January 1932, Lodi, Calif. Citation: For
                    conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and
                    beyond the call of duty. 1st Sgt. Yabes distinguished himself with Company
                    A, which was providing security for a land clearing operation. Early in
                    the morning the company suddenly came under intense automatic weapons and
                    mortar fire followed by a battalion sized assault from 3 sides.
                    Penetrating the defensive perimeter the enemy advanced on the company
                    command post bunker. The command post received increasingly heavy fire and
                    was in danger of being overwhelmed. When several enemy grenades landed
                    within the command post, 1st Sgt. Yabes shouted a warning and used his
                    body as a shield to protect others in the bunker. Although painfully
                    wounded by numerous grenade fragments, and despite the vicious enemy fire
                    on the bunker, he remained there to provide covering fire and enable the
                    others in the command group to relocate. When the command group had
                    reached a new position, 1st Sgt. Yabes moved through a withering hail of
                    enemy fire to another bunker 50 meters away. There he secured a grenade
                    launcher from a fallen comrade and fired point blank into the attacking
                    Viet Cong stopping further penetration of the perimeter. Noting 2 wounded
                    men helpless in the fire swept area, he moved them to a safer position
                    where they could be given medical treatment. He resumed his accurate and
                    effective fire killing several enemy soldiers and forcing others to
                    withdraw from the vicinity of the command post. As the battle continued,
                    he observed an enemy machinegun within the perimeter which threatened the
                    whole position. On his own, he dashed across the exposed area, assaulted
                    the machinegun, killed the crew, destroyed the weapon, and fell mortally
                    wounded. 1st Sgt. Yabesâ€™ valiant and selfless actions saved the lives of
                    many of his fellow soldiers and inspired his comrades to effectively repel
                    the enemy assault. His indomitable fighting spirit, extraordinary courage
                    and intrepidity at the cost of his life are in the highest military
                    traditions and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of
                    his country.</p>
