                <p>Master Sergeant Charles McGaha, Company G, 35th Infantry, 25th Infantry
                    Division, distinguished himself for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity
                    in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. On 7
                    February 1945, near Lupao, Luzon, Philippine Islands, Sergeant McGahaâ€™s
                    platoon and one other from Company G were pinned down in a roadside ditch
                    by heavy fire from 5 Japanese tanks supported by 10 machineguns and a
                    platoon of riflemen. When one of his men fell wounded 40 yards away, he
                    unhesitatingly crossed the road under a hail of bullets and moved the man
                    75 yards to safety. Although he had suffered a deep arm wound, he returned
                    to his post. Finding the platoon leader seriously wounded, he assumed
                    command and rallied his men. Once more he braved the enemy fire to go to
                    the aid of a litter party removing another wounded soldier. A shell
                    exploded in their midst, wounding him in the shoulder and killing two of
                    the party. He picked up the remaining man, carried him to cover, and then
                    moved out in front deliberately to draw the enemy fire while the American
                    forces, thus protected, withdrew to safety. When the last man had gained
                    the new position, he rejoined his command and there collapsed from loss of
                    blood and exhaustion. Sergeant McGaha set an example of courage and
                    leadership in keeping with the highest traditions of the service.</p>
