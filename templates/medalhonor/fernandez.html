                <p>Specialist Fourth Class Daniel Fernandez, Company C, 1st Battalion, 5th
                    Infantry (Mechanized), 25th Infantry Division, distinguished himself by
                    conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty.
                    Specialist Fernandez demonstrated indomitable courage on 18 February 1966
                    at Cu chi, Hau Nghia Province, Republic of Vietnam. His patrol was
                    ambushed by a Viet Cong rifle company and driven back by the intense enemy
                    automatic weapons fire before it could evacuate an American soldier who
                    had been wounded in the Viet Cong attack. Specialist Fernandez, a sergeant
                    and two other volunteers immediately fought their way through devastating
                    fire and exploding grenades to reach the fallen soldier. Upon reaching
                    their fallen comrade the sergeant was struck in the knee by machine gun
                    fire and immobilized. Specialist Fernandez took charge, rallied the left
                    flank of his patrol and began to assist in the recovery of the wounded
                    sergeant. While first aid was being administered to the wounded man, a
                    sudden increase in the accuracy and intensity of enemy fire forced the
                    volunteer group to take cover. As they did, an enemy grenade landed in the
                    midst of the group, although some men did not see it. Realizing there was
                    no time for the wounded sergeant or the other men to protect themselves
                    from the grenade blast, Specialist Fernandez vaulted over the wounded
                    sergeant and threw himself on the grenade as it exploded, saving the lives
                    of his four comrades at the sacrifice of his life. Specialist Fernandezâ€™
                    profound concern for his fellow soldiers, at the risk of his life above
                    and beyond the call of duty are in the highest traditions of the United
                    States Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of
                    his country.</p>
