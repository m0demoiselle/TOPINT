                    SERGEANT WILLIAM G. FOURNIER

                <p>Sergeant William G. Fournier, Company M, 35th Infantry, 25th Infantry
                    Division, distinguished himself for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity
                    in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. On 10
                    January 1943, Mount Austen, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, Sergeant
                    Fournier was leader of a machine-gun section charged with the protection
                    of other battalion units, his group was attacked by a superior number of
                    Japanese, his gunner killed, his assistant gunner wounded, and an
                    adjoining guncrew put out of action. Ordered to withdraw from this
                    hazardous position, Sergeant Fournier refused to retire but rushed forward
                    to the idle gun and, with the aid of another soldier who joined him, held
                    up the machinegun by the tripod to increase its field action. They opened
                    fire and inflicted heavy casualties upon the enemy. While so engaged both
                    these gallant soldiers were killed, but their sturdy defensive was a
                    decisive factor in the following success of the attacking battalion.
                    Sergeant Fournierâ€™s selfless concern for his comrades, and intrepidity at
                    the cost of his own life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping
                    with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great
                    credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.</p>
