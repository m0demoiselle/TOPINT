                <p>Technician Fourth class Laverne Parrish, Medical Detachment, 161st
                    Infantry, 25th Infantry Division, distinguished himself for conspicuous
                    gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and
                    beyond the call of duty. Technician Parrish was medical aid man with
                    Company C during the fighting in Binalonan, Luzon, Philippine Islands. On
                    18 January 1945, he observed two wounded men under enemy fire and
                    immediately went to their rescue. After moving one to cover, he crossed 25
                    yards of open ground to administer aid to the second. In the early hours
                    of the 24th, his company, crossing an open field near San Manuel,
                    encountered intense enemy fire and was ordered to withdraw to the cover of
                    a ditch. While treating the casualties, Technician Parrish observed two
                    wounded still in the field. Without hesitation he left the ditch, crawled
                    forward under enemy fire, and in two successive trips brought both men to
                    safety. He next administered aid to 12 casualties in the same field,
                    crossing and re-crossing the open area raked by hostile fire. Making
                    successive trips, he then brought three wounded in to cover. After
                    treating nearly all of the 37 casualties suffered by his company, he was
                    mortally wounded by mortar fire, and shortly after was killed. The
                    indomitable spirit, intrepidity, and gallantry of Technician Parrish saved
                    many lives at the cost of his own. Technician Parrishâ€™s selfless concern
                    for his comrades, and intrepidity at the cost of his own life above and
                    beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the
                    military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the
                    United States Army.</p>
